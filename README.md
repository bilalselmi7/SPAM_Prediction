# SPAM_Prediction
In this project you'll find an app.py file which contain our API which use the folders Templates and Static.

When you launch it, you'll see a Form where you can write an Email and the program will predict for you if it is a SPAM or not.

The model has been built in the Projet_SELMI_FADILI.ipynb where you will find all the steps to build our best model.

You'll also find a Pdf report where we explain everything we did.
